The system to be developed is a simple loyalty card solution, where the customer accumulates points and can redeem them to purchase products, services, and travel. The following functionalities will be developed:

• Customer and loyalty card registration: done on a single screen, which should request the following customer data: CPF (Brazilian ID), full name, date of birth, gender, income, and full address. When the customer is registered, the system automatically generates the loyalty card number, which is the concatenation of the customer's CPF with the customer's registration date.
• Customer modification: done on the same customer registration screen. The operator enters the customer's CPF, the registered data is loaded on the screen, and it is possible to modify them, except for the CPF.
• Points: a simple screen where the operator enters the loyalty card number of the customer and the quantity of points to be credited, and after a button is pressed, the system generates a points record and updates the customer's points balance.
• Redemption: a simple screen where the operator enters the loyalty card number of the customer, the quantity of points to be redeemed, selects the type of redemption (product, service, travel) and, after a button is pressed, the system generates a redemption record and updates the customer's points balance.
• Balance and statement inquiry: a screen where the operator enters the loyalty card number of the customer and all the customer's redemptions and point records, as well as their current balance, are shown.
• Customer report: a screen that shows the list of all customers. On the screen, the operator defines the sorting criteria (by name, by ascending balance, by descending balance, by ascending age, by descending age).

Developed during Object-oriented programming classes at CESAR.
